# Manifesto.... 
## - don't be an admin/programmer princess, relying on gui's and tools to do your job
## - visual editors are like flavors of the week, providing marginal productivity improvements over last weeks
## - stick with the bare bones (omg! I can't code cuz VisualCode/eclipse/fav gui editor... is missing)
## - Learn VI as a backup
## - rock the command line
## - same goes for (zsh) shells.  good to know but unnecessary to a basher
